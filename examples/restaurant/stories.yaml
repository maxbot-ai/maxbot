        Truck Stop Gourmand is the brainchild of Gloria and Fred Smith.
        What started out as a food truck in 2004 has expanded into a thriving restaurant.
        We now have one brick-and-mortar restaurant in downtown Portland.
        The bigger kitchen brought with it new chefs, but each one is faithful to the philosophy
        that made the Smith food truck so popular to begin with deliver fresh,
        local produce in inventive and delicious ways. <br />
        Join us for lunch or dinner seven days a week. Or order a cake from our bakery.
