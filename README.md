## Install Maxbot

For detailed installation instructions, see the
[documentation](https://maxbot.ai/getting-started/installation).

- **Operating system**: macOS / OS X Â· Linux
- **Python version**: Python 3.9 (only 64 bit)
- **Package managers**: [pip](https://pypi.org/project/maxbot/)

### Pip

Using pip, **Maxbot** releases are available as source packages and binary wheels.
Before you install **Maxbot** and its dependencies, make sure that
your `pip` and `wheel` are up to date.

When using pip it is generally recommended to install packages in a virtual
environment to avoid modifying system state:

```bash
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -U pip wheel
pip install maxbot
```

### Quick Start

For detailed installation instructions, see the
[documentation](https://maxbot.ai/getting-started/quick-start).

First, we configure channels. Channels are a way to integrate your bot with various messaging platforms.
You must configure at least one channel to create a bot. The telegram channel is configured by specifying secret `api_token` for the telegram bot.

> Telegram channel is the best choice for a quick start because it's easy to run right on your laptop.
> Telegram Bot API allows you to receive incoming updates via long polling, so you don't need to have an external IP and set up webhooks.

Save the bot scenario as `bot.yaml` or something similar.

```yaml
channels:
  telegram:
    api_token: 110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw
intents:
  - name: greetings
    examples:
      - Good morning
      - Hello
      - Hi
  - name: ending
    examples:
      - Goodbye
      - Bye
      - See you
dialog:
  - condition: intents.greetings
    response: |
      Good day to you!
  - condition: intents.ending
    response: |
      OK. See you later.
  - condition: true
    response: |
      Sorry I don't understand.
```

Run the MaxBot CLI app passing the path to the bot.yaml as a parameter.

```bash
$ maxbot run --bot bot.yaml
âœ“ Started polling updater... Press 'Ctrl-C' to exit.
```

Open your bot in telegram messenger and greet it.

- Type `Hello`. You will see the appropriate response: *"Good day to you."*
- Type `bye` and the bot will reply *"OK. See you later."*
- Enter a message unknown to the bot, `How are you?` Get a response: *"Sorry I don't understand."*

The output in your console will look like this

```
[01/27/23 23:06:44], telegram#123456789
ðŸ§‘ Hello
ðŸ¤– Good day to you!

[01/27/23 23:06:48], telegram#123456789
ðŸ§‘ bye
ðŸ¤– OK. See you later.

[01/27/23 23:07:03], telegram#123456789
ðŸ§‘ How are you?
ðŸ¤– Sorry I don't understand.
```

Press `Ctrl-C` to exit MaxBot CLI app.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and launched a simple bot and chatted with it.
